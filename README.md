## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the company understand their customers better.Through different charts, they get to know their critical areas like total loan taken for different purposes,default rate per year/employment type & year on year loan amount change be it total loan taken or number of loan taken.Therefore, they can improve their loan lending and receiving strategy by identifying these area.

Since, the default rate per year is more than 11% this imply that company needs to make sure that they get loan back which they are lending.

Also, out of 32 billion rupees of loan lended majority is given to high income bracket leading if company wants to expand their customer base then they should tap to medium and low income bracket.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop from sql server, dataset is an csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the column has errors.  
- Step 5 : DAX is used to find "Total loan"              
```bash
                           Loan amount by purpose = SUMX(FILTER('Loan_default part 412',NOT(ISBLANK           
                         ('Loan_default part 412'[LoanAmount]))),'Loan_default part 412'[LoanAmount])
```
 A line graph was used to show "Loan amount taken for different purposes".

<img width="417" height="303" alt="loan amount by purpose" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07dcef10-4df4-4527-8052-19b74606bf6d" />

  

- Step 6 : DAX is used to find "Average income by employment type"
```bash
                        Average income by employment type = CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Loan_default part  
                        412'[Income]),ALLEXCEPT('Loan_default part 412','Loan_default part 412'
                        [EmploymentType]))
```
  Line graph added to show "Average income by employement type".    

- Step 7 : DAX is used to find "Default rate vis-a-vis to total by employment type"
```bash

                   Default rate vis-a-vis to total by employment type = var total=COUNTROWS(ALL('Loan_default part 412'))     
                   var default=COUNTROWS(FILTER('Loan_default part 412','Loan_default part 412'[Default]=TRUE()))       
                   return CALCULATE(DIVIDE(default,total))*100
```
   Line graph added to show "Default Rate(%) by Employment Type"
- Step 8 : DAX is used to add new column "Age group"
 ```bash
                   Age group = IF('Loan_default part 412'[Age]<=19,"Teen",IF('Loan_default part 412'[Age]<=39,"Adults",IF('Loan_default part 412'[Age]<=59,"Middle Aged","Senior Citizens")))
 ```
- Step 12 : In the report view, under the insert tab, two text boxes were added to the canvas, in one of them name of the airlines was mentioned & in the other one company's tagline was written.
- Step 13 : In the report view, under the insert tab, using shapes option from elements group a rectangle was inserted & similarly using image option company's logo was added to the report design area. 
- Step 14 : Calculated column was created in which, customers were grouped into various age groups.

for creating new column following DAX expression was written;
       
        Age Group = 
        
        if(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Age]<=25, "0-25 (25 included)",
        
        if(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Age]<=50, "25-50 (50 included)",
        
        if(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Age]<=75, "50-75 (75 included)",
        
        "75-100 (100 included)")))

- Step 15 : New measure was created to find total count of customers.

Following DAX expression was written for the same,
        
        Count of Customers = COUNT(airline_passenger_satisfaction[ID])
        
A card visual was used to represent count of customers.

 - Step 16 : New measure was created to find  % of customers,
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find % of customers,
 
         % Customers = (DIVIDE(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Count of Customers], 129880)*100)
 
 A card visual was used to represent this perecntage.

 - Step 17 : New measure was created to calculate total distance travelled by flights & a card visual was used to represent total distance.
 
 Following DAX expression was written to find total distance,
 
         Total Distance Travelled = SUM(airline_passenger_satisfaction[Flight Distance])
    
 A card visual was used to represent this total distance.

 - Step 18 : The report was then published to Power BI Service.
